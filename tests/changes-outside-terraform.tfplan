Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the
last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # aws_instance.instance_1 has changed
~ resource "aws_instance" "instance_1" {
        id            = "i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      ~ instance_type = "t2.micro" -> "t2.small"
    }

  # aws_s3_bucket.bucket_1 has been changed
~ resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket_1" {
        id  = "my-bucket"
      ~ acl = "private" -> "public-read"
    }

  # aws_instance.instance_destroyed has been destroyed
- resource "aws_instance" "instance_destroyed" {
      - id            = "i-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy" -> null
      - ami           = "ami-0c55b516cb98f8221" -> null
      - instance_type = "t2.micro"      -> null
      - tags          = {
          - "Name" = "DestroyedInstance"
        }
    }

  # aws_instance.instance_deleted has been deleted
- resource "aws_instance" "instance_deleted" {
      - id            = "i-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy" -> null
      - ami           = "ami-0c44b516cb10f8123" -> null
      - instance_type = "t2.micro"      -> null
      - tags          = {
          - "Name" = "DeletedInstance"

    }

Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the
relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.create_1 will be created
+ resource "aws_instance" "create_1" {
      + ami           = "ami-0c55b516cb98f8221"
      + instance_type = "t2.micro"
      + tags          = {
          + "Name" = "CreateInstance1"
        }
    }

  # aws_instance.update_2 will be updated in-place
~ resource "aws_instance" "update_2" {
        id            = "i-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz" # (actual ID will vary)
      ~ ami           = "ami-0a12b345c6d7e890f"
    }

  # aws_instance.destroy_2 will be destroyed
- resource "aws_instance" "destroy_2" {
        id            = "i-wwwwwwwwwwwww" # (actual ID will vary)
      - ami           = "ami-0c55b516cb98f8221" -> null
      - instance_type = "t2.micro"      -> null
      - tags          = {
          - "Name" = "DestroyInstance2"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 2 to change, 2 to destroy.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.create_1 will be created
+ resource "aws_instance" "create_1" {
      + ami           = "ami-0c55b516cb98f8221"
      + instance_type = "t2.micro"
      + tags          = {
          + "Name" = "CreateInstance1"
        }
    }

  # aws_instance.update_1 will be updated in-place
~ resource "aws_instance" "update_1" {
        id            = "i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      ~ instance_type = "t2.micro" -> "t2.small"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
~ complex_output = {
    - "key1" = "initial_value_1"
    - "key2" = [
        "item1",
        "item2",
    ]
    - "key1" = "new_value_1"
    - "key2" = [
        "item1",
        "item3",
    ]
    + "key3" = "added_value"
  } -> (known after apply)
~ list_output    = [
    - "old_item_1",
    - "old_item_2",
  ] -> (known after apply)
+ list_output_added    = [
    "new_item_1",
    "new_item_2",
    "new_item_3",
  ]
~ string_output  = "old_string" -> "new_string"
- string_output_deleted  = "deleted_string"
+ string_output_created  = "created_string"
- string_output_deleted_two  = "deleted_string"
